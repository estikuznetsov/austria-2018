	<p>In 2018, my husband and I went on a two-week trip to Austria.
	
	<p>We landed at Munich airport, as it is close to the Austrian border and the area we wanted to focus on.
	<br>We rented a car for the two weeks so that we could reach as many different points as possible in the amazing landscapes of Austria.</p>
	<p>Although we planned to see mostly natural landscapes, we also incorporated a few urban tourist sites.
	<p>For city trips, we spent a day in Salzburg and another day in Innsbruck.
	<br>The rest of the time we drove through amazing views to different natural sites.</p>
	<p>We traveled through various creeks and waterfalls, climbed cable cars to snowy peaks, and incorporated one day of skiing at the Hintertux glacier.</p>
	<p>It was a great trip, full of amazing views and activities.</p>
